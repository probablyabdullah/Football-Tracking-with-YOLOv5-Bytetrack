# **Football Players Tracking on a pitch using YOLOv5 + ByteTrack**
## A YOLOv5-based object detection model that identifies and tracks the players, the ball, the sideline referees and the goalkeeper separately when provided with a TV broadcast camera feed. Bytetrack is further used to enhance the model's capabilities! ⚽

## About
In my project, I utilized Roboflow Universe, an open-source computer vision dataset repository with over 100,000 datasets. We make use of two pretrained models one after another and apply custom annotations on the latter to get our output.
